# Web Scraping Baniola.tn

This is a Python script for web scraping car information from the website baniola.tn. The script imports several libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, numpy, and unidecode.

The script defines three functions.

1. The `get_car_info` function gets information related to a specific car from its URL. It extracts information such as price, city, brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, gearbox type, and equipment. The function takes in the car URL and a dictionary of parameters to store the extracted information.
2. The `get_cars_url` function gets the URLs of all cars on a specific page. It takes in the basic URL for the website and the page number, and returns a list of URLs for all cars on that page.
3. The `main` function is the main entry point of the script. It initializes an empty dictionary to store the extracted car information. It then loops over all pages on the website, gets the URLs of all cars on each page, and then calls the `get_car_info` function to extract the information for each car. The extracted information is stored in the dictionary. Finally, the function returns the dictionary of extracted information.

After calling the `main` function, the script creates a pandas DataFrame from the extracted information and exports it as a CSV file.
